Hi I am rishika

main branch:-

git add 
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push 

git switch "branch name".  -- git switch branch1


gir reflog  --- gives all the commit messages


change. from current commit to previous commit


git reset --hard " id"


commit id- is called commit hash


>>changing from one branch to another :

here: from branch1 to main branch 
# 1. Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# 2. Make sure it's up to date
git pull RISHIKA-A-S main

# 3. Merge branch1 into main
git merge branch1

# 4. Push main branch to remote
git push RISHIKA-A-S main
